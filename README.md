# Workbook 6 â€“ Java Practice Projects

This folder contains my Java exercises from Workbook 6.

## ðŸ“˜ Exercises Included

### âœ… WorkingWithInterfaces
- Demonstrates how to use the `Comparable` interface to sort custom objects
- Defines a `Person` class with three fields:
  - `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`
- Implements the `compareTo()` method to sort:
  - First by last name
  - Then by first name if last names match
  - Then by age if both names match
- Creates an `ArrayList<Person>` and adds sample data to it
- Uses `Collections.sort()` to sort the list
- Great practice for:
  - Implementing Java interfaces
  - Writing custom sorting logic for objects
  - Using `compareTo()` to control sort behavior
  - Understanding the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`
